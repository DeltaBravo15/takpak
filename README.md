## Project title
# takpak
Python Library and sample code to create CoT's and send them to a TAK server

## Motivation
This library was created to allow the generation and push of CoT's to TAK servers. Goals:
* Do so in a way that does not break or put unusual loads on the servers. (ATAK client interaction with the server was the example followed)
* Allow the libraries to be used by themselves (inject a raw CoT, or build a CoT, but not inject)
* Work with current servers. Most of the existing code on the web was significantly out of date, and did not work or caused server issues. 

## Build status
The code is in funcitonal state, but continues to evolve/improve. Creating CoT's is solid, as is opening/closing/sending cots to a server. Reads are a bit kludgey. They work, but do not differentiate between multiple CoT's, and those which cross the readbuffer size. A better approach may be to return one cot or multiple cots as a list, and save the fragments for the next read. But that requires the class to be stateful. So for now, it's usable, but the calling code will need to check for valid cots and reassemble any fragments. 

The code should work with any TAK server that does not use authorization or certs as it emulates an ATAK/CIVTAK client. But has only been tested against FreeTakServer. 

## Features
The takpak library consists of two python3 classes:
* takcot.py- which interacts with the TAK server
    * takopen(ip_address, [port=ur_port_number]) Opens the socket to the server.
    * takclose() Closes out the session (Important for proper server interaction!)
    * taksend(cotdata) Sends a cot to the currently open server
    * takflush() Reads any pending data from the server, quietly ignores it
    * takread() Attempts read from the server, and returns it. Will loop readattempts times, and the timeout can be set. 
* mkcot.py

## Code Example
See the two sample programs (sendcot.py and readcots.py)

## Installation
No real install. Just import the classes into your code. Usually best to keep it in a subdirectory. Down the road I may release via PIP.

## How to use
See code examples.

## Credits
While takpak is original code, it would not be possible without the multitude of tools and projects that provided insight into how TAK servers behave, and how to interact with them. This is primarily FreeTakServer (https://github.com/FreeTAKTeam/FreeTakServer) and ATAK/CIVTAK (https://www.civtak.org/). 

Push_cursor_on_target (PCOT)was a bit of inspiration. While quite old, and not functional for server use, it did provide one example of how CoT generation and sending to a client could be done. I chose a different direction for my code, as the CoT generation and server interaction are two separate libraries. The ID and Dimension list definitions were used from their code, as there are only so many ways to capture a standard definitions like CoT uses in Python. The Element Tree method of building XML's that PCOT used also informed my code development. Again, there are only so many ways to efficiently create XMLS's in python.

CoT (Cursor on Target) format, definitions, etc are widely documented on the web and were invalable for understanding how to create a CoT. But blackbox reverse engineering of how the ATAK/CIVTAK client interacted via network traces and instrumentation was required to generate CoT's acceptible by modern servers.
